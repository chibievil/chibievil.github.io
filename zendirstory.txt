zane: I've been trying to tell you, Zaphilia... But you ran off. It was one disaster after another. And now, the crops are dead. But I know it wasn't you.
It was the water. I've managed to convince a few, but the rest remain firm. Many are trying to travel to the mainland now. Are you sure you won't come with us?

Zaphilia: And I've kept telling you Zane, nobody believed me. Just because I'm a magician, they chased me out. Of course they won't let me travel with them!

Zane: You may not be able to get onto the airship they're constructing, but I know someone who may be able to help.

Zaphilia: Who's that?

Zane: Anya. She's looking around the village for you ever since the mob chased you out.

Zaphilia: Anya...

*The waves crash against the beach. In the horizon lies an island dominated by a massive volcano. Seagulls squark overhead, before diving into the sea and swooping up their prey.

Zaphilia: Soon... I Can go to Zendir...



*Zaphilia's home*

Zaphilia: I've been waiting... Waiting ever since I was old enough to understand.
But I don't think they're coming back. Not what they realised what I was.


I said my first Word.
The curtains burst into flame.
My mother dropped me.
My father ran to get the bucket.
he doused the curtains with water.
"What shall we do?" My mum said.
"The only thing we can." My fathe replied.
He opened the front door.
My mother walked out.
My father followed.
The door closed.
I never saw them again.

Zapillia: *Sniff*
